# Negative Circle Procedure

Afternoon class on breakdown of the <negativecircle>.

Descriptions relate to example of pulling a rubber cord attached to the wall with a carabiner in a negative circle.

### Restrictions (described by Winston)
* First move of the negative circle:
* Hand has a point on it like the carabiner on the wall.
* Hand is restricted in track of the line of the rubber cord.  Hand is passive, pulled by elbow.
* Elbow connected to the kua, so elbow is also passive, pulled by kua.
* Shoulder like a CV joint, transmitting power but doesn't move.
* Kua movement like a shaft.  Kua rotating pulling elbow to move.
* Creates a stretch like the arm is the rubber band.

### CV joint
* Transmits power and gets rid of unnecessary power at the same time.
* Like a cart stacked full of books, a push can easily move it along its wheels.

### Traditional vs modern
* Traditional way is to not to tell you.  You are enlightened by observing and discovering the master is doing something you are not.
* Modern way is to show you, to describe everything in detail.  But by the time you understand it there is no impact, no shock.  And you miss it because the mystery is not there.

### Rubber cord vs stick
* Drawing a circle with either a rubber cord or stick:
  * With rubber cord, there is a stretch in the cord as it extends around the circle, it unstretches coming back.
  * With a stick, there is no stretch in it, you just move the stick around.  So it is just tossing.

### Carabiner and rubber cord example
* Kua rotate with the spine as the center, the finger has to not move like the carabiner on the wall.  The side of the body opening up stretches like the rubber cord.

### Stretch to spiral
* The body needs to have this stretch, in <jingangdaodui> first move.
* It has to stretch open.  10 inches stretched into 18 inches.  Only then it is a spiral.  Otherwise it is just turning in place.
* Training to be more solid or more elastic.  We are training to be more elastic.
* Like the underneath of the armpit is reversing.
* In this move, you can still stretch in with elbow even when hand cannot move.

### Two types of mistakes
* No fight on the hand (trying to pull hand in).
* Move body / tilt shoulder in.

### Longer 
* Train to be longer (coiling).  The inside becomes very long: that is where the power is and the freedom of movement is.  Have to have length.  In push hands, this translates to wrapping around (gaining of points) to constrict the opponent's movement until they can only fall down.

### Characteristics
* The hands never moved, the body coiled.  Characteristics of our specific school (of taiji).  Same theory as other taiji, but interpreted differently.
* In learning, be aware of more, but concentrate / focus on one until it works.  All the same, but different perspective.

### Double negative circle
* Hands in place at the bottom.
* Armpits push hands out.
* Armpit flips over.
* Then it is on the elbow.

### 著 `zhuó` clutch 
* Elbow must be clutched onto the torso.  Like a series of clutches.  So that they connect together in sequence.

### Backward / forward, outside / inside
* Backward move (kua) creates forward thrust of the finger.  For the negative circle this should go backwards into the rear foot, not the rear shoulder.
* Lock the outside move the inside.  Reversal of this move is to lock the inside move the outside.
