# Six Sealing Four Closing

Zoom lecture covering [[[liufengsibi]]]

* Use the dantian to connect to the elbow. Connect the rear leg to the arm through the kua, bypassing the upper body.

* When the move comes from the very inside, the thought is that it gets multiplied by 9.

### Shoulder goes down
* Shoulder needs to go down to go through.  It cannot go forward.  To not get involved.
* Put a stick on the shoulder to show that it should not fight the stick, it should bypass it.

### Habits
* It's wrong because your body can't sense it, you can only hear the words.  To correct it will take 3 years.  To correct ingrained habits.

### Instructions
1. Kua push up ( so that head goes up )
2. Shoulder push down
3. Hand goes out

* Hand cannot swing to the left / back.

* Hand rotates because the body rotates it.  Hand cannot follow the waist.

### Stretches
* Hand on the line, does not make moves on its own.  Must maintain stretch through hand.
* Will make your body look bigger because of the stretches in the body.

### Tearing
* Always keep in mind the purpose of the move.
* The two hands are placed and you want to stretch the forward hand forward and the rear hand backward.
* Like you're holding a towel in both hands and tearing it apart.
* First using your arms, then shoulder, then kua.

### Three primary exercises
* Pairs of three.  Three primary exercises to practice tearing.
* 3 major directions.
1. [[[twisttowel]]] front
2. [[[fetchwater]]] downwards and to the side
3. [[[liufengsibi]]] levelled and 45 degrees to the side

### Automatic transmission
* Six sealing four closing is an automatic transmission: Switching gear all the time but so smooth you can't feel it.
  * The ratio between back and front changes as it changes from front kua to rear kua.
  * Grab on (neutral) 50/50.
  * Initiate: Then push hand a little (first gear) still 50/50.
  * If opponent is strong, pivot closer to him.  If weak, pivot far away.
  * Switching must be a process that the opponent cannot feel.

* Question: if it relates to the 64 trigrams (no).
  * But at a theoretical level (yes).  The 64 trigrams relate to changes, at a theoretical level.
