# Pole Shaking
* Moves 3 to 5 in [[[yemafenzong]]].
* Front is negative circle, back is positive.

### Demo with a pole
* First, the front hand serves as pivot (doesn’t move), back hand does a positive circle. When it does appear to move, it is the body moving.

### Sequence
* Lock the hand on (like it is on a table and cannot follow your body down), body down.
* Maintain lock on hand, use the front kua to rotate.
* Lock the front axis (so it doesn’t follow the hand out), pull the hand out.
* Throughout: keep the eyes fixed in line with hand.

### Corrections
* Alternating lock front and back.
* Use a lot of body to pull on the hand.
* Body like a screw, hand fixed.

### Perspective change
* The distance between shoulder and hand is locked like a stick. When it rotates, the perspective/angle changes.
