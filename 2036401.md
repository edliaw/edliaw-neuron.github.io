# Thursday Yilu

### Distinction of rotation and shifting
* [[[danbian]]]: often we turn too early.  Insert the foot, lever to the middle, then turn.

### Clear moves
* We tend to make too many moves.  When going forward, we wiggle or add unnecessary movements.

### Commander in chief
* The moves are all right, but they have to be tied together to accomplish something.  The power comes from the core rotation.

### Braking
* Shuttle: when stepping back, the front kua and foot does not move, acts as the brake.  The back step makes you move; not step / then move.

### [[[jingangdaodui]]]
1. Open chest to split hands.
2. Elbow in.
3. Kua goes down to pull bottom of the forearm down.
4. Rotate.
5. Power on top of forearm, goes into leap.
