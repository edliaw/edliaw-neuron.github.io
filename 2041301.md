# Yilu class

### Knowing
* Daoist idea, Humans made correctly but the abilities we have throw us off.
* Don’t know when you get it, and when you think you get it, you don’t.
* Whatever it is, you don’t know it.  And whatever you know it isn’t what it is.

## Jody
### Emphasis
* Performing the form with the emphasis
* The lead needs to have the power, speed, protruding angle.
* Elbow on a table, push the shoulder down to drive hand up.  Wujibifan.  Matter extreme must reverse.  When you follow the rules and do something, matter reverses itself (yang becomes yin at the extremes).  Landmark principle of yin yang.

### Solid
* Find the solid.  One hand touch the side of the box to allow the next part to move.  Need 3 points to make you solid.  Then set back on the wall.

## Paddy
### Step-wise
* Teaching and learning method.  Step by step.
* No pulling and pushing.  Have to rotate and place.  Movements must be independent in their dimension.
* Elbow must place to cover distance in twist step.

## Yuxin
* Shoulder propels the elbow.  Levered power.  Action inside the elbow.

## Wenming
* Need the ability to both generalize and be specific.  Until you can do both, you haven’t really understood it.  Need to verbalize the difference to find it.  Gives you a totally fresh perspective.

## Brian
### Inflection point and twist
* Spiral (to go over with the kua).  Needs to have the inflection point across which the orientations switch.  Has to be a twist.
* Crankshaft - what the body does to create a rotation from sticks.  The turning over point.  The bicycle is more advanced.  The crankshaft has unevenness where it gets stuck and turns over.  丹田内转 dan tian nei zhuan.  Every move you’re looking for the point where adjusting a little gives you the room to go over to the other side.  That little bit is the agility / the life / the catalyst.  Machine moves until you give it a soul.  That intent has to be there.
* Can make the core very thick (cylinder) or very thin (fine line).
