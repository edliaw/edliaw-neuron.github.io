# Positive and Negative Circles

The positive and negative circles are two foundational exercises that practice a full revolution of the body.
They are circles in the sense that they loop; however the path that the hand takes when performing the exercise is intentionally egg-shaped.
The rear curvature is thick, and the front is thin.

While the exercises are fixed routines, they can also be generalized to the two directions of <revolution> of the body (正旋 `zhèng xuán` and 反旋 `fǎn xuàn`).
In this sense, every movement in Taijiquan can be considered to be part of a positive or negative circle.
