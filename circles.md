# Positive and Negative Circles

The positive and negative circles are two foundational exercises that practice a full revolution of the body.
They are circles in the sense that they rotate; however the path that the hand takes when performing the exercise is intentionally egg-shaped.
The rear curvature is thick, and the front is thin.
