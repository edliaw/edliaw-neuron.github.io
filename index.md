## About me ![avatar](static/favicon.jpeg){#avatar .ui .right .floated .small .image}

Hi, I'm Edward.
Professionally, I work as a software engineer for bioinformatics applications and data pipelines.
My daily practice is Chen-style Taijiquan <practicalmethod>: I am a disciple of <chenzhonghua>.

I've created this blog using Srid's [neuron-template](https://github.com/srid/neuron-template) Zettelkasten published by [neuron](https://neuron.zettel.page/).
