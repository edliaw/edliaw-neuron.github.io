# Edward Liaw

Welcome to my blog!  I will collect my notes here on all the things I read and learn, generally on the topics of Taijiquan, programming, genomics, and mathematics.

## About me ![avatar](static/favicon.jpeg){#avatar .ui .right .floated .small .image}

Professionally, I work as a software engineer for bioinformatics applications and data pipelines.
I practice Chen-style Taijiquan Practical Method: I am a disciple of [Chen Zhonghua](http://practicalmethod.com) ([陈中华](https://www.shiyongquanfa.cn/)).

I've created this blog using Srid's [neuron-template](https://github.com/srid/neuron-template) Zettelkasten published by [neuron](https://neuron.zettel.page/).
